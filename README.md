Can Data Analytics and AI Reshape and Optimize Learning in Education?


This project analyzes multiple datasets from Kaggle to explore how data analytics and artificial intelligence can help personalize education and improve student performance.

## 📊 Topics Explored

- Impact of parental education & occupation on student grades
- Correlation of study hours and attendance with exam scores
- Effects of stress levels, age, gender, extracurricular activities, and sleep on performance
- Influence of social media usage and career motivation

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQL Workbench
- Excel
- Kaggle Datasets

## 📁 Datasets

- [Student Performance in Math and Portuguese](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrigaankjaswal/student-performance-in-mathematics-and-portuguese)
- [Student Performance Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)
- [Education in Egypt](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedalabasy/education-inegypt)

## 🧠 Key Findings

- Higher parental education (especially maternal) correlates with higher student scores.
- More study hours and better attendance improve performance, but there are outliers.
- Moderate stress, motivation for career, and participation in extracurriculars boost results.
- Social media usage above 2h/day is negatively correlated with grades.

## 📄 Final Report

You can find the main analysis and findings in the PDF report:

## 📈 Example Visualizations

Some visualizations are included in the `/figures` directory, such as correlation heatmaps, bar charts by parental education, and more.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Add machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression)
- Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit or Dash)
- Extend dataset with more countries/schools
